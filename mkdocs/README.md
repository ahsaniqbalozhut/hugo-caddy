- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) must be installed and running

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Site Locally

```bash
bash run.sh
```

The site will be available at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

---

## üìù Updating the Documentation

1. **Edit any `.md` file** under the `docs/` directory (e.g. `docs/seo.md`, `docs/branding.md`, etc.)
2. **Ensure the file starts with** the following metadata block (YAML frontmatter):

   ```md
   ---
   title: "Your Page Title"
   date: 2025-07-19
   draft: false
   ---
   ```

3. **Commit and push your changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update documentation"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Wait for the GitHub Actions pipeline** to complete.
5. (Optional) **Run the site locally** to preview your changes:

   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

## üåê Making the Website Live at `supremedental.ocooee.com`

The documentation site is made publicly accessible via [https://supremedental.ocooee.com](https://supremedental.ocooee.com) using a Cloudflare Tunnel and Docker, deployed via Ansible.

### üì¶ Deployment Playbook

- **Playbook**: `/do/ansible/playbooks/ocooee-supreme.yml`
- **Reference**: Appears as **playbook #11** in the `play.sh` orchestration script
- **Target**: Deployed on a **pre-existing dev server (`mysql1`)** to avoid provisioning additional infrastructure

> üõ†Ô∏è **First-time setup:** Refer to inline comments in `ocooee-supreme.yml` for instructions specific to initial deployments, such as Docker installation and tunnel configuration.

### üöÄ To Deploy Updates

After your GitHub commit and once the CI pipeline finishes:

```bash
ansible-playbook /do/ansible/playbooks/ocooee-supreme.yml
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Expected Downtime:** There may be a brief service interruption (~30 seconds) while the container is rebuilt and restarted.

Once the playbook completes, the latest version of the documentation will be live.

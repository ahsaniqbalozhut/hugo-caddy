# **Supreme Dental Clinics – Discovery & Opportunity Assessment Report**

**Prepared by:** King Ting – IT & Operations Consultant
**Date:** 12 May 2025
**Meeting Date:** 7 May 2025
**Attendee(s):** Grace Tan (Owner was unavailable)

---

## **Executive Summary**

Supreme Dental Clinics is a multi-location dental group operating across Melbourne. The business has grown through acquisitions and currently functions with a high degree of independence at each clinic site, each maintaining its own identity due to historical branding and affiliations with insurance providers such as BUPA and Medibank.

Despite this decentralised structure, there is a shared commitment to patient care, community engagement, and service excellence. This initial discovery meeting provided valuable insights into clinical workflows, technology infrastructure, marketing efforts, staff development needs, and equipment management.

Several opportunities for improvement were identified:

* Brand unification under the “Supreme” umbrella
* Digital coordination between clinics
* Standardisation of processes including payment handling and communication
* Staff training, particularly in soft skills and technical troubleshooting
* Introduction of formal project management and HR procedures
* Exploration of a Preventive Care Incentive Plan to encourage regular visits
* Implementation of a preventive equipment maintenance program

This report serves as the foundation for deeper exploration and planning. With further input from the owner and additional stakeholders, we can develop a prioritised action plan that aligns with long-term goals and positions Supreme Dental Clinics as a leading provider in every location they serve.

## **Organisational Structure & Roles**

The clinic group comprises multiple locations, some operating under different names or partnerships due to past acquisitions. Each clinic operates semi-independently but shares the parent brand “Supreme Dental Clinics.”

**Key Roles Identified**

| **Role**                        | **Responsibilities**                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dentist                         | Primary care provider; responsible for diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient communication                                                                                |
| Dental Assistant                | Supports dentists during procedures, manages instruments, prepares patients, assists with chairside tasks                                                                      |
| Practice Manager / Receptionist | Handles front desk duties including appointment scheduling, billing, patient check-ins, and basic administrative tasks. In smaller clinics, may also serve as the receptionist |

*Note:* Larger clinics may have more defined roles, while smaller ones often combine responsibilities. Further clarification from individual clinic managers would be beneficial.

## **Clinical Workflow & Operational Systems**

**Core Software Tools**

| **Tool**                            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dental Practice Management Software | Online, subscription-based system used for booking, scheduling, patient records, reminders. Accredited and cannot be easily replaced due to compliance requirements |
| X-ray Imaging Software              | Operated independently at each clinic. No cross-clinic integration or sharing mechanisms mentioned                                                                  |

**Workflow Highlights**

* Patient appointments are managed through the dental software.
* Follow-up reminders (e.g., recall visits) are automated via the same platform.
* Billing and accounting are handled separately using the Xero Accounting application.
* Payment Workflow: The owner personally processes some payments, which provides visibility into financial operations but may offer opportunities for streamlining while preserving oversight.
* Communication between staff members relies primarily on face-to-face interactions or phone calls.

**Opportunity Area**

Potential exists to digitise and automate more aspects of internal communication, patient follow-ups, and inter-clinic coordination. Given the nature of dental services — where continuity and trust play a major role — ensuring consistent, proactive communication both within the team and with patients will help strengthen patient retention and satisfaction over time.

## **Technology Infrastructure**

**Network & Telecommunications**

* Managed by an external provider.
* Includes telephone system, Wi-Fi, internet connectivity, and remote access tools.
* No specific issues reported regarding network reliability or downtime.

**Communication Tools**

* Standard telephony and email used.
* Video conferencing or collaboration tools not explicitly mentioned.
* *Need for Clarification:* It is unclear whether any form of cloud-based file sharing, team collaboration tools (e.g., Teams, Slack), or centralised documentation storage exists.
* *Suggested Next Step:* Further discussions with IT or facilities managers are recommended.

**Facilities & Security**

* **Physical Access:** Standard keys and access codes used. No significant concerns reported about physical access control. Limited number of digital systems requiring login credentials.
* **Surveillance:** Traditional CCTV cameras deployed. Centralised monitoring system in place. No advanced analytics or AI-driven surveillance tools utilised.

**Cross-Clinic Coordination**

* Not a priority area at present. Referrals occur between clinics based on specialisation or availability. No shared digital infrastructure to support inter-clinic workflows.

*Potential Gap:* As the clinic group grows, having a more integrated approach to referral management and resource allocation could become increasingly important.

---

## **[Branding & Marketing Strategy](3.0MarketingMain.md)**

**Current Status**

* The umbrella brand “Supreme” is being developed.
* Branding is inconsistent across clinics due to historical acquisitions.
* Some clinics are affiliated with major insurers like BUPA and Medibank — this is seen as a competitive advantage.

**Website & SEO**

* A main corporate website links to individual clinic websites.
* SEO efforts are outsourced to a third party.
* Focus is on improving local search rankings (e.g., “dentist near me”) and ensuring each clinic website ranks highly for its location.
* No structured content publishing plan currently exists to support ongoing SEO performance.

**Strategic Considerations for Website Structure**
There may be opportunities to consolidate under a single domain while still allowing for localised landing pages tailored to each geographic area. This could help:

* Build stronger equity for the “Supreme” brand
* Improve SEO performance through internal linking and domain authority
* Streamline management and maintenance of digital assets

Further discovery would be required to evaluate:

* Technical feasibility of migration
* Impact on existing local SEO performance
* Brand alignment readiness across clinics
* Resource requirements for ongoing content and domain management

This would likely form part of a strategic planning phase, not immediate execution.

**Social Media Readiness**
Social media activity is currently in its infancy across the group. No formal strategy exists, and there is no dedicated resource managing social media accounts or content calendars. Experiments with platforms such as Facebook and Instagram exist but lack consistency.

Without a coordinated approach, the potential to build community trust, showcase services, and reinforce brand values through social channels remains largely untapped.

**Content Publishing & Organic Reach**
There is currently no formal content marketing strategy in place. The potential for educational content — blogs, videos, downloadable guides — is recognised but not yet developed.

An opportunity exists to use content to:

* Support SEO performance
* Build trust and credibility within local communities
* Educate patients on preventative care and treatment options
* Engage multicultural audiences through multilingual content

**Differentiators**
One key strength is the multilingual team of dentists serving a wide range of ethnic communities. This is underutilised in marketing. The ability to tailor pricing strategies to local demographics offers a competitive edge that could be emphasised further.

There is clear potential to reframe linguistic and cultural diversity as a core brand differentiator, especially in areas where culturally sensitive dental care is limited.

## **Staff Development Needs**

**Highlighted by General Manager**

* *Soft Skills Training for Dentists:* Customer handling, patient engagement, building rapport and trust.
* *Technical Troubleshooting for Practice Managers:* Day-to-day equipment issues, basic maintenance and problem identification.
* *Ongoing Professional Development for Dentists:* Self-managed continuing education and accreditation.

**Additional Points for Future Discussion**

*Telephone Handling Skills for Receptionists* — As first point of contact, receptionists shape patient perception. Structured training on call etiquette, appointment confirmation, and managing difficult conversations could enhance the customer journey.

*Recommendation:* Consider implementing a customer service training program for both clinical and admin staff.

---

## **Strategic Priorities (Limited Discussion)**

Due to the owner’s unavailability, long-term goals were not fully explored. Based on the general manager’s input:

* Growth plans include expanding services and possibly new locations.
* Technology is seen as a potential enabler, but no roadmap exists yet.
* Standardisation is challenging due to existing structures and partnerships.

**Next Step:** A follow-up session with the owner is essential to clarify direction, growth ambitions, and technology’s role.

---

## **Human Resources Management**

*Notes:*

* HR functions (recruitment, onboarding, reviews, leave tracking) were not discussed in detail.
* Likely managed informally or by the accountant/bookkeeper. No dedicated HR system was mentioned.

*Area for Further Exploration:*

* How staffing needs are fulfilled
* Onboarding/offboarding process
* Performance review system
* Tools used for HR data and processes

*Suggested Next Step:* Engage with the accountant/finance lead to assess if a more structured HR system would benefit the organisation.

---

## **Project Management Approach**

*Notes:*

* The group is large and growing; various improvements (website redesign, marketing, equipment upgrades) may be underway.
* No formal project management structure discussed.
* Without central coordination, managing improvements across clinics could be complex.

*Area for Further Exploration:*

* How projects are initiated, planned, and executed
* Who oversees project timelines and deliverables
* Any tools or templates used for tracking or reporting

*Suggested Next Step:* Discuss with the General Manager or senior leads whether introducing a light project management framework could improve coordination and accountability.

## **Future Opportunity: Preventive Equipment Maintenance Program**

Currently, servicing is reactive — only when issues arise — leading to unexpected failures, increased repair costs, and disruptions.

**Proposed Initiative**

* Regular inspections and servicing of dental chairs, X-rays, compressors, etc.
* Use a digital tracking system for service history and scheduling.
* Train practice managers to identify early issues and perform basic troubleshooting.
* Establish vendor relationships for faster responses and consistent quality.

This would ensure equipment reliability, reduce downtime, and extend asset life.

*Next Step:* Discuss with facility or operations leads to explore options for a standardised maintenance process across clinics.

---

## **Future Opportunity: Preventive Care Incentive Plan**

A Preventive Care Incentive Plan could encourage regular visits by offering incremental benefits tied to a preventive schedule — without changing standard fees — reducing out-of-pocket costs for committed patients.

It would strengthen relationships and loyalty and drive organic growth through referrals. This could become a strong differentiator for Supreme Dental Clinics and be supported by future process improvements and digital tools.

Further exploration is needed to assess feasibility, compliance, and implementation strategy.

---

## **Conclusion**

This discovery meeting laid a solid foundation for understanding Supreme Dental Clinics’ current state. The group demonstrates strong clinical operations and localised care, but key opportunities exist in:

* Standardising systems and branding
* Integrating technology
* Enhancing marketing and brand strategy
* Staff training and development
* Centralised knowledge and resource sharing

With further engagement, a prioritised plan can be mapped to align with the strategic vision. Reinforcing long-term patient relationships through improved systems and consistent experiences will be key to sustainable growth.

---

## **Next Steps**

* Schedule follow-up with the Owner to confirm priorities and long-term goals.
* Engage stakeholders:

  * Facility/IT managers
  * Marketing leads
  * Clinic practice managers
  * Finance/accounting
* Conduct deeper dives into:

  * Digital workflows and automation
  * Patient engagement and retention
  * Inter-clinic coordination
  * Staff training metrics
  * Human resources and project management

A three-tier action plan will be developed:

* Short-Term Quick Wins (0–3 months)
* Medium-Term Improvements (3–6 months)
* Long-Term Strategic Initiatives (6+ months)
